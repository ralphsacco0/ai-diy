  "rationale": "These three stories form a complete, coherent Employee Directory Management increment: US-002 (Add Employee Profile) first to establish database writes and form handling for new profiles, building directly on the existing auth (US-009) and dashboard (US-999) from SP-001. US-001 (Employee Directory Search) follows to enable querying and displaying the added data, creating a readable directory. US-004 (Update Employee Profile) completes the CRUD cycle by allowing edits to existing profiles, ensuring updates reflect in searches. Technical dependencies are met: All rely on US-009 (Done) and US-002 (included before dependents). This order (Add \u2192 Search \u2192 Update) builds foundation (data creation) to features (discovery and maintenance), avoiding partial functionality. The result is fully testable: An HR user logs in, navigates via the role-based sidebar to add a profile, searches for it, and updates it\u2014end-to-end demonstrable with seeded data. No conflicts (shared DB table handled sequentially), thematic focus on directory CRUD, and lightweight for ~20 minutes execution using existing Express/SQLite stack. Delivers high MVP value: Secure, searchable, updatable employee roster for HR oversight."
