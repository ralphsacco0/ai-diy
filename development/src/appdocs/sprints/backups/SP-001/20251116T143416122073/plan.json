  "rationale": "Starts with the mandatory Tech Stack NFR to create a runnable local Mac setup (React + Node/Express + SQLite), ensuring portability and no cloud deps. Then implements authentication as the security gatekeeper\u2014users can log in/out, roles are enforced, and it's testable end-to-end (e.g., via localhost login flows). This generates working, secure code as the project's base layer, aligning with vision constraints (local Mac, GDPR basics). Total scope is tight to hit ~20 mins, building toward employee directory/leave features next."
