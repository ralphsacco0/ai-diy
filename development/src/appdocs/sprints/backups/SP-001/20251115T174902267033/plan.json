  "rationale": "NFR-001 establishes the local Mac environment (Node.js/Express/React/SQLite with npm start/stop scripts), providing the foundation for all development. US-009 implements secure user authentication (login/logout with hashed passwords and basic role sessions), enabling protected access to future features like the employee directory. This minimal sprint ensures a testable, secure app skeleton aligned with Vision constraints (local-only, GDPR basics). Dependencies respected: Auth uses the setup's DB/session tools. Post-execution, we'll have a login-protected localhost app ready for expansion."
