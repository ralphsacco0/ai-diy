  "rationale": "Foundational authentication sprint: Implement US-009 for secure user login/logout with role-based sessions, followed by NFR-004 to enforce HR vs. Employee permissions. This creates a testable secure entry point, aligning with MVP security needs (GDPR compliance, hashed passwords). Dependencies: None. Value: Enables protected access for all future features like employee directory and leave management. Estimated at 20 minutes for Flask routes, Supabase integration, tests, and role middleware."
