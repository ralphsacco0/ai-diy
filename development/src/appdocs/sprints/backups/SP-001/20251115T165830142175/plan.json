  "rationale": "NFR-001 establishes the local Mac environment (Node/Express/React/SQLite with npm scripts) as the required foundation. US-009 adds user authentication (login/logout, role sessions) on top, enabling secure access for all MVP features. This creates a testable app skeleton: run `npm start`, login at localhost:3000, verify roles. Aligns with vision constraints (local, lightweight, GDPR basics) and keeps execution under 20 mins."
