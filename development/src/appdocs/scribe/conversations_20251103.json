Let me analyze the backlog quickly based on your goal: a sprint that handles mock login, adding an employee, and searching the directory.\n\n### My Analysis\nFrom the vision and backlog, the MVP focuses on the employee directory as a foundation (searchable profiles with basic CRUD). We don't have real auth yet, so US-010 (Mock Login) is perfect as a lightweight entry point\u2014it just accepts any credentials and redirects to a dashboard. Then, US-015 (Add Employee) lets HR add a new profile, populating the database. Finally, US-001 (Employee Directory Search) builds on that by letting users search and view results. These are all User Stories (US-###), so they'll generate actual Flask/HTML/Supabase code + tests\u2014no wireframes or styles here.\n\n- **Dependencies & Ordering**: Mock login first (no barriers to access). Add Employee next (needs login to protect the form, and it seeds data). Search last (relies on added data to show real results; integrates with the login redirect).\n- **Testability**: Each has clear acceptance criteria\u2014e.g., login redirects, add saves to Supabase with validation, search paginates and handles empty results. We can test end-to-end: login > add > search for the new employee.\n- **Time Estimate**: About 20 minutes total execution\u2014login is simple (5-7 min), add is a basic form (7-8 min), search is a table with queries (8-10 min). Fits our target perfectly.\n- **Value**: This gives us a working prototype flow right away: users \"log in,\" add a team member, and search them up. It aligns with MVP must-haves, sets up the directory backbone, and makes future stories (like updates or leave requests) easier to build on. No blockers from NFRs or integrations yet.\n\n### Proposed Sprint: SP-002 (Core Directory Flow)\n- **Stories**: US-010 (Mock Login Page), US-015 (Add Employee Profile), US-001 (Employee Directory Search)\n- **Rationale**: Builds a minimal viable directory in one go\u2014login for access, add for creation, search for discovery. High value for early demos, fully testable, and dependency-safe. Skips wireframes since we're focusing on code.\n\nDoes this look good to you? Any tweaks, like adding/removing a story or prioritizing differently? If you're happy, I'll save the sprint, mark these as \"In Sprint,\" and we can kick off execution!"

That way, the sprint generates testable code without dependencies biting us later.\n\nQuick analysis of the backlog: With the reset, we're starting fresh. The MVP focuses on employee directory basics, so the foundation is key: a simple entry point (login) to add and search profiles. No auth yet, but US-010's mock login gets us a working flow quickly. Everything's in Backlog except some lingering statuses\u2014I'll handle updates to \"In Sprint\" once we agree.\n\n**Proposed Sprint (SP-003 - clean start):**\n- US-010: Mock Login Page (High priority, ~5-7 min: basic form that redirects to dashboard)\n- US-015: Add Employee Profile (Medium, ~7-8 min: form to create profiles, saves to Supabase)\n- US-001: Employee Directory Search (Medium, ~5-7 min: search and list profiles, builds directly on US-015)\n\n**Why this grouping?**\n- **Dependencies & Order:** Mock login first for app entry (testable standalone). Then add profiles (needs Supabase setup, testable with success messages). Finally, search (pulls from added data, fully testable end-to-end). No blockers\u2014uses wireframes WF-002, WF-015, WF-001 as refs.\n- **Testability:** Each generates Flask routes, HTML forms, Supabase integration, and basic tests. We can verify: login works, add saves data, search displays it.\n- **Value & Time:** Hits core MVP (employee management) early. Total ~20 min execution. Foundational before leave/docs features.\n- **Alternatives:** If you prefer just login + search (skip add for now, ~12 min), or add onboarding (US-008) later, let me know\u2014we can tweak.\n\nDoes this sound good, or want to adjust (e.g., add US-002 for updates)? Once approved, I'll save the sprint, update statuses, and we can kick off execution. Ready?"

        "message": "Mike: Hey, totally fair question\u2014let's break this down so I can explain what's happening on my end (based on how the API and my tools work) and why recreating a pre-existing sprint ID like SP-001 is tricky, even after a \"delete\" or reset attempt.\n\n### Why the Sprint ID Recreation Issue?\n- **API Limitations**: My only tool for interacting with the backend is the `http_post` function, which hits endpoints like `/api/sprint` for saving/creating sprints and `/api/backlog/update-story` for story statuses. There's no explicit \"delete\" endpoint defined in my toolkit (or apparently supported by the server\u2014remember that error we saw: \"Sprint ID is required\" when I tried to nuke SP-003? It suggests the API might not handle deletions at all, or it's expecting a different payload/action). So, if a sprint like SP-001 was created before, it likely still exists in the database as a record, even if the stories were reset to \"Backlog.\" The system treats sprint IDs as unique keys, so when I try to \"save\" a new one with the same ID (e.g., `sprint_id: \"SP-001\"`), it probably conflicts\u2014either throwing an error (like a 400/duplicate key) or silently failing/overwriting in a way that doesn't clear the old data properly.\n  \n- **What Happens in Practice**: From the error messages we've seen in past interactions (e.g., the 400 on delete), the server isn't wiping the sprint records cleanly. It's like the sprints are \"ghosted\"\u2014the stories can be unassigned and moved back to Backlog (which I did successfully for US-001, US-010, and US-015), but the sprint itself lingers as an empty shell. If I propose and \"save\" SP-001 again, the API might reject it due to the ID already being in use, or it could create a messy duplicate state. That's why we've had these hiccups in prior sprints; the restore/refresh process you're running might not be propagating deletes fully to the sprint table.\n\n- **My Constraints Here**: I can't directly query the database, list existing sprints, or force a delete\u2014I'm limited to the POST actions in my workflow. If the API had a \"delete\" action (e.g., `{\"action\": \"delete\", \"sprint_id\": \"SP-003\"}`), I'd use it, but it doesn't seem to. This is probably a backend gap we could fix later (maybe add a delete endpoint?), but for now, it means starting \"fresh\" requires either:\n  - Using a brand-new sprint ID (like SP-004) to avoid conflicts.\n  - You manually wiping the sprint records via your admin tools during the restore process (which sounds like what you're doing right now\u2014great call).\n\nOnce your re-restore is done, we should be golden. If the old SPs are still there post-restore, let's just bump to SP-004 for this one to sidestep the issue entirely\u2014no harm in that, as the ID is just a label.\n\n### Back to Planning: Let's Get Sprint 1 (or SP-004) Going\nWith the stories reset, the backlog is clean and ready. To keep momentum: What do you want to accomplish with this sprint? For example:\n- Build the absolute foundation: Start with the mock login (US-010) to get a working entry point, then add basic employee creation (US-015) so we have something testable in the directory (ties into US-001 search).\n- Or focus on employee directory basics right away: US-015 (add profile) + US-001 (search/view) for a quick MVP win on core HR data.\n\nGive me your top priorities (e.g., auth first? Employee management?), and I'll propose 2-5 User Stories with reasoning on dependencies, testability, and ~20-min execution. We can use SP-001 if your restore clears it, or SP-004 as a safe bet. Sound good?"

These are core pieces for getting something testable up and running quickly. Let me analyze and propose based on the backlog.\n\n### Quick Analysis\n- **Backlog Context**: We have US-010 (Mock Login) as a simple entry point (no real auth, just redirects to dashboard\u2014high priority). US-015 (Add Employee Profile) lets HR add basic profiles (name, email, phone, role) with minimal validation, feeding directly into the directory. US-001 (Employee Directory Search) builds on that by allowing search/view of profiles (paginated, clickable details). These align with MVP must-haves: employee directory basics.\n- **Why These?** No dependencies on unfinished work (mock login stands alone). They form a logical flow: Login \u2192 Add Employee \u2192 Search/View. Total estimated execution: ~15-20 minutes (simple Flask routes, Supabase inserts/queries, basic HTML forms, and tests). Fully testable end-to-end. Skipping wireframes (e.g., WF-002, WF-015, WF-001) since they're refs only\u2014not code deliverables. No NFRs or styles needed yet.\n- **Ordering for Execution**: 1) US-010 (login scaffold), 2) US-015 (add data), 3) US-001 (search on data). This ensures we have something to search after adding.\n- **Value**: Gets us a working prototype for employee management\u2014secure access (mock), data entry, and lookup. Builds toward leave/docs features later. GDPR export (US-013) can hook in post-MVP.\n\n### Proposed Sprint: SP-001\nStories: [US-010, US-015, US-001]  \nEstimated: 20 minutes  \nRationale: Foundational user flow for directory. Mock login enables access; add profile populates data; search makes it usable. All generate testable code (Flask endpoints, Supabase CRUD, UI forms). Dependencies minimal\u2014relies on global setup (which we can assume from US-016 if needed, but not blocking). High business value for small biz owners to onboard and find team info fast.\n\nDoes this match what you had in mind? Any tweaks, or approve to lock it in?"

Since you mentioned cleaning everything out, I've double-checked the backlog\u2014Sprint SP-001 is already queued with the foundational User Stories that build a basic employee management flow:\n\n- **US-010: Mock Login Page** (High priority: Simple entry point to the app, redirects to dashboard\u2014no auth barriers for testing.)\n- **US-001: Employee Directory Search** (Medium: Searchable list of profiles, paginated\u2014core MVP feature.)\n- **US-015: Add Employee Profile** (Medium: Form to create new profiles\u2014feeds directly into the directory.)\n\n**Rationale Recap (from prior planning):** This sprint focuses on the employee directory foundation. Mock login first (dependency for access), then add employee (creates data), then search (uses that data). All testable end-to-end: login > add > search. Estimated ~20 minutes total execution. No dependencies on unfinished stories; wireframes (WF-002, WF-001, WF-015) serve as UI refs but aren't blocking code gen.\n\nEverything looks ready\u2014no conflicts, statuses are \"In Sprint,\" and it's aligned with the vision (MVP must-haves for directory).\n\nReady to start execution? Just say \"yes\" or \"go,\" and I'll kick it off!"

That sprint includes the foundational pieces: US-010 (Mock Login Page), US-001 (Employee Directory Search), and US-015 (Add Employee Profile). These build a basic auth flow, searchable directory, and way to add profiles\u2014all testable and dependent on each other for a solid MVP start.\n\nQuick recap on why this grouping works:\n- **Dependencies**: Mock login (US-010) first for access, then add employee (US-015) to populate data, and search (US-001) to view it. No prior sprints needed.\n- **Testability**: Each generates Flask routes, HTML/Tailwind UI, Supabase integration, and tests\u2014verifiable locally via setup script (US-016 isn't in yet, but we can run without it).\n- **Time/Value**: ~20 minutes estimated; delivers a working directory prototype for HR users to add/search employees post-login.\n- **Ordering**: Login \u2192 Add \u2192 Search for logical flow.\n\nIf this aligns with what you want (or if you'd like to tweak/add stories), just say \"approved\" or give feedback. Once ready:\n\nReady to start execution? (This will trigger the code gen for SP-001.)"

You asked me to check on SP-1 (Sprint Planning sprint ID SP-001) to see if it's ready to re-run, so I tried querying the backend API via a POST request to fetch its status and details (like execution history, completion status, etc.). Unfortunately, the request failed with a 400 error because the API endpoint I hit required a full Sprint ID in the path or payload, and my call didn't format it quite right\u2014likely a \"SP-001\" vs \"sp-1\" mismatch or missing params.\n\nNo harm done; it's just a local API hiccup. To get this sorted:\n\n- Can you confirm the exact Sprint ID (e.g., SP-001)? From the backlog, I see SP-001 has stories like US-001, US-010, and US-015 assigned to it, and it's in an \"In Sprint\" state.\n- If it's already executed or partially done, re-running might overwrite progress\u2014want me to try pulling the full status again with the corrected ID, or should we just proceed to re-execute it directly?\n- Alternatively, if you want to start fresh, we could propose a new sprint based on the backlog.\n\nWhat\u2019s your preference here? Ready to retry the check or jump into re-execution?"
