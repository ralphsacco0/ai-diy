Let me quickly analyze the current backlog and confirm what's in it.\n\n### Quick Backlog Analysis\n- The MVP focuses on building a solid base: authentication (even if mock), employee management (add/search), and basic data handling with Supabase.\n- SP-001 currently includes these User Stories (all marked \"In Sprint\" and ready for re-execution):\n  - **US-010: Mock Login Page** (High priority) \u2013 Basic login form that redirects to dashboard. No real auth yet, just for flow testing.\n  - **US-001: Employee Directory Search** (Medium) \u2013 Search and view profiles. Builds on added data.\n  - **US-015: Add Employee Profile** (Medium) \u2013 Form to create new profiles. Essential for populating the directory.\n- Dependencies: US-010 provides entry point; US-015 creates data; US-001 lets you interact with it. All integrate with Supabase for storage and the mock login for access.\n- No wireframes or styles here\u2014these are pure code deliverables (Flask routes, HTML forms, Supabase CRUD, basic tests).\n- Total estimated time: ~20 minutes (quick foundation sprint; login ~5min, add ~7min, search ~8min). High testability: Each has clear acceptance criteria (e.g., form submits, search paginates, redirects work). Value: Gets us a working employee CRUD loop post-login, aligning with MVP must-haves.\n\nThis grouping makes sense for re-execution\u2014it's the core entry and data layer before layering on features like leave requests. No NFRs or nice-to-haves yet to keep it lean.\n\n### Proposed Sprint: SP-001 (Re-Execution)\nStories: [US-010, US-015, US-001]  \nRationale: Re-run to ensure a clean, testable base.

These are all User Stories focused on foundational UI and basic data operations.\n  - US-010 provides a simple entry point (mock auth) to test the app flow.\n  - US-001 builds the core directory search, which is searchable and testable.\n  - US-015 adds the ability to create profiles, which feeds directly into US-001 for immediate verification.\n- **Dependencies & Testability:** US-010 has no deps (it's mock). US-015 and US-001 depend on basic Supabase setup but can be tested end-to-end (e.g., add a profile, search for it, login flow works). No NFRs or wireframes needed here\u2014they reference WF-002, WF-001, and WF-015 for styling guidance.\n- **Time Estimate:** ~20 minutes total execution, as these are lightweight Flask/HTML routes with Supabase inserts/queries and basic tests.\n- **Value:** Gets us a working prototype dashboard with login, add/search employees\u2014aligns with MVP must-haves for the employee directory. Prioritizes foundation before features like leave requests.\n- **Why These?** They form a logical, independent group: auth mock \u2192 add data \u2192 view/search data. Skipping wireframes (e.g., WF-001) since we're code-focused. No criminal/offensive content issues here.\n\n### Proposed Sprint (Re-run SP-001)\nStories: [US-010, US-001, US-015]  \nEstimated: 20 minutes  \nRationale: Re-executing the foundational sprint to ensure a clean, testable employee directory with mock login. Builds directly on the vision's employee profiles feature. If we need adjustments (e.g., add/remove a story), let me know\u2014otherwise, this keeps momentum.\n\nDoes this sound good, or do you want to tweak the stories before re-running?"
