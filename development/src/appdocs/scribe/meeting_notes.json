      "Mike: Ah, gotcha\u2014thanks for clarifying! If SP-001 and SP-002 (along with their stories like auth, Supabase integration, and employee directory) have been fully deleted or reset, that clears the deck completely. We're starting fresh with a clean backlog, which is a great opportunity to build the foundation right from the MVP vision: secure auth first, then layer on core features like the employee directory for basic profiles and self-service.\n\nWhat do you want to accomplish in this sprint? Since we're at ground zero, my analysis of the backlog points to prioritizing high-value, low-dependency user stories that generate testable code (Flask + HTML + Supabase + tests). We should avoid wireframes (WF-###) entirely\u2014they're just refs\u2014and skip NFRs unless they're tied to immediate code. Target: ~20 minutes of execution time, focusing on dependencies (auth before anything role-based).\n\n**Proposed Sprint: SP-001 - Authentication and Backend Foundation**  \nStories: [US-006, US-008]  \nEstimated time: ~20 minutes  \nRationale:  \n- **Dependencies**: US-006 (Basic Authentication and Role-Based Access) is the absolute starting point\u2014without it, no secure logins or role checks (admin vs. employee) for any other features. US-008 (Supabase Backend Integration) follows immediately, setting up the database tables, auth policies, and realtime for all future CRUD. These two are tightly coupled and standalone; no other stories depend on them yet, but everything else will block without this. (WF-006 is just a UI ref for styling via STYLE-001.)  \n- **Testability & Ordering**: Execute US-006 first for login/signup flows (testable with JWT sessions, role redirects), then US-008 for DB setup (testable with sample data inserts/queries via Supabase). Both produce working code: protected routes, secure storage, and API endpoints. Easy to verify\u2014e.g., login as admin/employee, check RLS blocks unauthorized access, run basic CRUD.  \n- **Value**: Nails the vision's security basics (GDPR-compliant auth) and enables the full MVP (self-service for employees, admin controls). This gets us to a testable skeleton app quickly, aligning with target users' need for streamlined, secure HR tools. Skips fluff like dashboards (US-007) for now\u2014pure executable foundation. Fits 20 mins without overload.  \n\nAlternatives: If auth feels off-base, we could pivot to US-001 (Employee Directory) alone for a quick win on profiles (~15 mins), but it'd be insecure without US-006. Or bundle in STYLE-001 if UI consistency is a priority first. Does this proposal work for you, or want to adjust (e.g., add/remove stories)? Approve, and I'll save it to kick off!"

These are critical dependencies for everything else (e.g., secure data storage and access control), and they're high-priority MVP enablers. No wireframes or NFRs here\u2014just USER STORIES for working code.\n\n### Proposed Sprint: SP-001 (Foundation: Auth & Backend Setup)\n**Stories:** US-006 (Basic Authentication and Role-Based Access), US-008 (Supabase Backend Integration)  \n**Estimated Time:** 20 minutes  \n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- **Dependencies & Ordering:** US-006 sets up secure login/signup with roles (admin/employee), which US-008 builds on for Supabase tables, RLS policies, and auth integration. Do auth first for protected routes, then backend for data ops\u2014ensures testability from the ground up. Both depend on nothing prior, but enable all future US stories (e.g., US-001 needs auth to protect directory access).  \n- **Testability:** US-006: Test login flows, role redirects, session persistence. US-008: Verify tables, CRUD, realtime subs, file storage with sample data. Both generate testable Flask routes, Supabase setup, and basic tests.  \n- **Value:** Gets us a secure, integrated backend skeleton\u2014aligns with Vision's GDPR basics and low-cost Supabase/Vercel deployment. Covers ~40% of MVP foundation without UI bloat. Total fits 20-min execution for quick wins.  \n\nThis mirrors a good example sprint: foundational and testable. Alternatives: If you want to skip recreating auth (since it was done before), we could pivot to SP-001 as just US-008 + US-001 (Directory), but let's stick to pure foundation for now. Sound good?

      "Mike: Based on your focus on easy-to-test stories, I'm proposing **Option 1** as the best starter sprint: specifically **US-010 (Mock Login Page)** and **US-001 (Employee Directory Search)**. This combo is self-contained, foundational, and directly testable without overcomplicating things\u2014total estimated time ~18 minutes. It gets us a working app flow (login \u2192 searchable directory) that's quick to verify in the browser and via tests, aligning with the MVP's employee directory must-have for fast team lookups.\n\n### Why These Specific Stories (US-010 + US-001)?\n- **Logical Grouping:** They form a minimal end-to-end flow: Mock login sets up the app's entry point and redirects to a dashboard, where the directory search lives. This avoids \"naked\" features and builds a prototype you can actually navigate like a real user. Both are high/medium priority in the backlog, with clear acceptance criteria (AC) for testability.\n- **Dependencies & Ordering:** \n  - US-010 first: Creates basic routes (e.g., /login \u2192 /dashboard) and a simple form. No dependencies\u2014it's standalone mock auth (any email/password works, no real Supabase auth yet).\n  - US-001 second: Builds on the dashboard to add search functionality. Depends lightly on US-010 for the UI container, but could even be adapted to run without if needed. Uses Supabase for querying seed employee data (we'll assume basic inserts for testing).\n- **Testability:** Super straightforward\u2014prioritized for your request:\n  - US-010: Test by entering any credentials \u2192 auto-redirect to dashboard (manual: browser check; automated: Flask route test in pytest + response status 302).\n  - US-001: Search by name/role/email \u2192 paginated list displays (max 20 results, clickable profiles) or \"no results\" message (manual: input \"John Doe\" \u2192 see name/email/role; automated: Supabase query test + HTML assertion for table elements). Handles edge cases like empty DB easily.\n  - Overall Sprint Test: Full flow (login \u2192 search \u2192 view results) in ~5 minutes; no complex workflows or approvals.\n- **Value & Alignment:** Delivers immediate ROI\u2014owners/HR can \"quickly find team members without spreadsheets\" (Vision goal). Covers ~50% of the directory must-have in one go, sets up for future sprints (e.g., adding US-002 updates next). Keeps it lightweight (web-only, Supabase queries only) and under budget constraints. Plus, it's motivational: You'll have a demo-able search page right away!\n\nIf this feels right, just say \"approve\" or tweak it (e.g., swap in US-002 instead for edits). We can always add a third if it fits under 20 min. Ready to lock this in as Sprint SP-001?"

Everything's in Backlog except some lingering statuses\u2014I'll handle updates to \"In Sprint\" once we agree.\n\n**Proposed Sprint (SP-003 - clean start):**\n- US-010: Mock Login Page (High priority, ~5-7 min: basic form that redirects to dashboard)\n- US-015: Add Employee Profile (Medium, ~7-8 min: form to create profiles, saves to Supabase)\n- US-001: Employee Directory Search (Medium, ~5-7 min: search and list profiles, builds directly on US-015)\n\n**Why this grouping?**\n- **Dependencies & Order:** Mock login first for app entry (testable standalone). Then add profiles (needs Supabase setup, testable with success messages). Finally, search (pulls from added data, fully testable end-to-end). No blockers\u2014uses wireframes WF-002, WF-015, WF-001 as refs.\n- **Testability:** Each generates Flask routes, HTML forms, Supabase integration, and basic tests. We can verify: login works, add saves data, search displays it.\n- **Value & Time:** Hits core MVP (employee management) early. Total ~20 min execution. Foundational before leave/docs features.\n- **Alternatives:** If you prefer just login + search (skip add for now, ~12 min), or add onboarding (US-008) later, let me know\u2014we can tweak.\n\nDoes this sound good, or want to adjust (e.g., add US-002 for updates)? Once approved, I'll save the sprint, update statuses, and we can kick off execution. Ready?"

I updated them all back to \"Backlog\" status with notes explaining the reset. This clears the deck without deleting any actual sprint data, but it frees them up for a clean new sprint.\n\nThe backlog is now fully reset, and we're good to go on Sprint 1. What do you want to accomplish with this sprint? For example, are we focusing on the foundational auth/login flow first (like US-010), or jumping into the employee directory basics (US-001 and US-015)? Let me know your priorities, and I'll propose a logical grouping of 2-5 User Stories."

US-015 (add data). US-001 (search/verify). NFR-001 ensures no barriers.\n- **Testability/Value**: Generates Flask/HTML/SQLite code + tests. End-to-end: Setup \u2192 Login \u2192 Add \u2192 Search on localhost:8001. Fixes Mac issues; matches MVP foundation.\n- **Minimal**: Only these for re-run + Mac fix. No extras.\n\nApprove for save/updates? Or trim (e.g., drop NFR-001)?"

No real auth, just for demo/testing flow.\n- Dependencies: None\u2014it's standalone and doesn't rely on database or other features yet. We can reference the mock login wireframe (WF-002) for UI guidance.\n- No other stories needed; keeping it to one for a quick ~5-10 minute execution to verify the login works in isolation on your Mac setup.\n- Value: Builds the entry point for the app, testable immediately (e.g., form submission redirects correctly). Aligns with foundation-building before adding features like employee directory.\n\n### Proposed Sprint: SP-002 (Rerun - Mock Login Only)\n- **Stories**: [US-010]\n- **Estimated Time**: ~5-10 minutes (quick UI + route setup, no backend complexity).\n- **Ordering**: Just US-010\u2014execute it directly.\n- **Rationale**: Focusing on just the login isolates any issues from previous sprints (like the Mac re-execution notes). It's testable (check redirect to /dashboard), generates working code (Flask route + HTML form), and sets up the app skeleton without security barriers per NFR-001.
