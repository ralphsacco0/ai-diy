We completed two key stories: **US-006 (Employee Directory Implementation)** and **US-008 (Leave Management Basics)**. These align with the core MVP features: employee profiles, leave requests, and basic navigation.\n\n#### What Was Built\n- **US-006: Employee Directory**\n  - A searchable table for viewing/adding employee profiles (name, email, job title, start date, phone, manager).\n  - Includes add/import CSV buttons and basic actions (view/edit/delete).\n  - Meets acceptance criteria: Responsive table, filters work, export generates CSV, GDPR export support stubbed.\n  - Files: Located in `execution-sandbox/client-projects/Unknown/src/components/EmployeeDirectory/` and related pages.\n\n- **US-008: Leave Management**\n  - Tabs for \"My Requests,\" \"Approval Queue,\" and \"Calendar View.\"\n  - Form for submitting leave requests (type, dates, reason); basic approval workflow.\n  - Simple calendar highlighting absences.\n  - Meets acceptance criteria: Tabs switch smoothly, form validates/submits, approve/decline buttons functional, mobile-responsive.\n  - Files: Located in `execution-sandbox/client-projects/Unknown/src/components/LeaveManagement/` and pages.\n\nThe app also includes a basic landing page (from WF-001) with hero, features grid, and CTAs, plus navigation to these screens. Document storage (WF-004) is stubbed but not fully implemented this sprint.\n\n#### Screens Included in the App\nAfter running the test command, you should see:\n1. **Landing Page**: Intro to BrightHR Lite2, features overview (Employee Directory, Leave Mgmt, Docs), sign-up CTA.\n2. **Employee Directory**: Main admin screen for profiles.\n3. **Leave Management**: Employee/admin screen for requests and approvals.\n4. **Basic Navigation**: Sidebar or top nav linking these, with login stub (demo mode).\n\nThe app uses Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design (mobile-first). No backend integration yet\u2014data is mocked for demo/testing. Focus is on user value: easy self-service for employees, quick admin oversight for small teams.\n\n#### How to Test\nPlease run `./test-generated-app.command` in the `execution-sandbox/client-projects/Unknown/` directory to launch the app locally. Test the flows:\n- Add/view employees.\n- Submit a leave request and approve it.\n- Check responsiveness on mobile view.\n\nOnce you've tested, share your feedback on usability, bugs, or missing features. Does it solve the spreadsheet pain points? Ready to review US-006 first?"
