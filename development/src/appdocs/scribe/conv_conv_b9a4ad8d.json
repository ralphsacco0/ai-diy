  "summary": "In this sprint planning discussion, the architect clarified assumptions that user stories US-010 (Mock Login), US-015 (Add Employee Profile), and US-001 (Employee Directory Search) were already implemented based on prior context, forming a foundational loop for the employee directory. If not done, the architect proposed prioritizing them in SP-001 for a minimal viable sprint before proceeding to enhancements.",
