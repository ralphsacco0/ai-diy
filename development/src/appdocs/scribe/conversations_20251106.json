        "message": "Hi! Great to chat sprint planning\u2014I'm Mike, your Sprint Planning Architect. I totally get the frustration with SP-001 not running smoothly on your Mac for testing. That's a common Phase 1 hiccup with local setups (especially on Apple Silicon), but we can absolutely address it here. The good news is the Vision is all about lightweight local dev (SQLite, HTTP on localhost, no cloud/auth barriers), so re-pulling those core stories into SP-002 with some targeted additions will make it testable and Mac-friendly.\n\n### Quick Analysis of the Backlog & Your Issue\nFrom the current backlog:\n- **SP-001 Stories (US-001, US-010, US-015)**: These are marked \"Done,\" but they focus on the employee directory basics (mock login \u2192 add profile \u2192 search). They're simple Flask/HTML/SQLite code with no real security, so they *should* run locally on your Mac via the setup script. If SP-001 failed to test (e.g., port blocks, env issues, or firewall prompts), it's likely because the automated setup (US-016) wasn't pulled in yet\u2014it's still in Backlog and handles Mac-specific init (pip installs, .env setup, seeding data, starting on port 8001).\n- **Key Gaps for Mac Testing**: US-016 (setup script) and NFR-001 (no security barriers) are perfect to include\u2014they ensure everything spins up with zero hurdles (arm64 compat, HTTP-only, SQLite persistence, firewall notes). Wireframes (e.g., WF-001, WF-002, WF-015) are just refs, no code. Other stories like leave requests (US-003) depend on this foundation but aren't needed yet.\n- **Dependencies**: Auth/mock login (US-010) first, then add/search (US-015/US-001). Setup (US-016) enables all. Total: Foundational, testable end-to-end (login \u2192 add employee \u2192 search).\n- **Time Fit**: These 5 stories (core trio + setup duo) should clock in at ~20 minutes execution\u2014lightweight, no NFR overload.\n\nRe-pulling the same core stories for SP-002 is a solid plan for verification/re-execution, especially since statuses allow it (we'll note \"re-added for Mac testing\"). This won't duplicate code; it'll regenerate if needed and let you test the full flow locally. If we include US-016/NFR-001, it directly fixes the \"could not test on Mac\" issue by enforcing no-security, local-only mode.\n\n### Proposed SP-002: Same Core + Mac Setup Boost\nLet's keep it to 4-5 stories focused on getting you a runnable, testable directory on your Mac. This builds the MVP foundation (employee profiles) while ensuring local dev works flawlessly.\n\n**Proposed Stories**:\n1. **US-010: Mock Login Page** (High, Done \u2192 Re-pull) \u2013 Basic form that accepts anything and redirects to dashboard. *Why?* Entry point for testing; no real auth, pure HTTP redirect.\n2. **US-015: Add Employee Profile** (Medium, Done \u2192 Re-pull) \u2013 Form to create profiles in SQLite. *Why?* Builds data for testing; minimal validation, links back to search.\n3. **US-001: Employee Directory Search** (Medium, Done \u2192 Re-pull) \u2013 Search/view profiles. *Why?* Verifies data persistence; paginated, clickable\u2014testable right after add.\n4. **US-016: Automated Local Setup Script** (Medium, Backlog) \u2013 Python script to init everything (install deps, seed test data, start Flask on localhost:8001). *Why?* Directly solves your Mac issue: Mac-compatible (M1/M2 checks, brew if needed), no Supabase/cloud, explicit no-security mode, and runs pytest for verification.\n5. **NFR-001: Local Testing: No Security Barriers** (High, Backlog) \u2013 Ensures HTTP-only, no auth checks, easy Mac teardown. *Why?* Optimizes the code for pure local testing (e.g., no HTTPS, SQLite only)\u2014include since there's setup code to tweak.\n\n**Ordering & Rationale**:\n- **Dependencies/Testability**: Start with US-016 (setup runs first, seeds data). Then US-010 (login flow). Follow with US-015/US-001 (add \u2192 search cycle). NFR-001 weaves in to strip any barriers. All generate working Flask/HTML/SQLite code + tests; testable via browser on localhost:8001 (e.g., add employee, search it, no login fails).\n- **Value**: Gets you a fully local, no-security app for Mac testing\u2014matches Vision's Phase 1 (local SQLite, import-ready basis). ~20 min total: Setup (~5 min), core UI (~15 min). Avoids wireframes (no code) or advanced features (e.g., leave\u2014save for SP-003).\n- **Mac-Specific Wins**: US-016 includes firewall disable notes, arm64 handling, and HTTP enforcement. If issues persist (e.g., port conflict), we can tweak post-execution.\n\n**Alternatives**:\n- **Slimmer (Just Re-Pull Core)**: Drop NFR-001/US-016 if you want exact SP-001 repeat (3 stories, 15 min)\u2014but I don't recommend; setup is key to your issue.\n- **Add One More?**: If you want progress, swap in US-014 (Import Data) for bulk loading spreadsheets\u2014depends on directory, testable locally.\n- **Too Much?**: We can trim to 3 if 20 min feels heavy.\n\nDoes this proposal sound good for SP-002, or want to adjust (e.g., add/remove stories, focus on a specific error you're seeing)? If approved, I'll save the sprint, update statuses, and we can kick off execution. Ready?"

        "message": "Mike: Hey, no worries\u2014I hear you loud and clear. Sprint planning is all about adaptability, especially when upstream changes (like Vision or requirements tweaks) make earlier executions feel off-base. The good news is the system is designed to handle re-execution without much hassle: we don't need a full \"reset\" of the entire backlog or database, but we can effectively reset the *effective state* for those SP-001 stories by pulling them into SP-002. This will re-generate the code, tests, and local setup based on the *current* (latest approved) Vision and requirements\u2014ensuring it's Mac-friendly, SQLite-only, no-security local testing as per Phase 1 constraints.\n\n### Analyzing the Situation & Feasibility\n- **Why SP-1 Felt Different**: The backlog shows SP-001 (US-001, US-010, US-015) was executed under an earlier context (e.g., possible Supabase mentions or less emphasis on Mac/no-security before the recent refinements to US-016/NFR-001). Their statuses are \"Done\" with execution timestamps, and Notes log re-adds/resets from past attempts. But the code output (Flask app, HTML, SQLite) is generated fresh each sprint based on current specs, so re-pulling applies the latest Vision (local dev, HTTP on 8001, mock bypasses, GDPR-lite).\n- **Resetting Values**: We can't \"undo\" the historical logs (that's for audit), but we can:\n  - Update statuses back to \"Backlog\" (or \"Ready\") via API to clear the \"Done\" flag.\n  - Pull them into SP-002 for re-execution, which regenerates everything (code, tests) using today's refined requirements (e.g., pure local SQLite, Mac compat from US-016 updates).\n  - No data loss\u2014SQLite db is local/teardown-able per NFR-001.\n- **Backlog Check**: Only those 3 were in SP-001; others remain Backlog. Re-pulling them won't conflict, and we can include setup enhancers to fix your Mac testing issue directly.\n- **Risks/Edge Cases**: If SP-1 left artifacts (e.g., old db file), US-016's script can wipe/reseed. Total time: Still ~15-20 min for these 3, plus optional setup.\n\nYes, this will let us run the *same stories* but with the *updated Vision/requirements* baked in\u2014making it testable on your Mac (e.g., quick setup, no firewall blocks, HTTP access).\n\n### Proposed SP-002: Re-Run the SP-1 Core with Current Specs\nTo keep it simple and focused on verification/testing, let's propose just the original 3 stories (all USER STORIES for code gen). This \"resets\" by re-executing them under the latest context\u2014no extras unless you want. If approved, I'll first reset their statuses (to \"Backlog\" for cleanliness), then save the sprint and mark them \"In Sprint.\"\n\n**Proposed Stories** (2-5 rule: Exactly 3, logical group):\n1. **US-010: Mock Login Page** (High priority, currently Done) \u2013 Basic email/password form that accepts anything and redirects to dashboard. Generates Flask route + HTML; no real auth.\n2. **US-015: Add Employee Profile** (Medium, Done) \u2013 Form for new profiles (name, email, phone, role) saving to SQLite. Minimal validation; success message + link to search.\n3. **US-001: Employee Directory Search** (Medium, Done) \u2013 Searchable list of profiles (paginated, clickable). Pulls from SQLite; no-results handling.\n\n**Explanation & Reasoning**:\n- **Dependencies & Ordering**: US-010 first (entry point, mock flow). Then US-015 (add data). Finally US-001 (search/verify data). All depend on local SQLite setup but generate self-contained code\u2014testable sequence: Login \u2192 Add \u2192 Search in browser.\n- **Testability & Value**: Each has acceptance criteria for working code (Flask endpoints, HTML forms, SQLite CRUD) + tests (pytest). End-to-end: A basic, secure-free directory app running on localhost:8001. Matches MVP Must-Haves (employee profiles); directly addresses your testing goal by regenerating with current no-security focus (e.g., HTTP-only from NFR-001 influence).\n- **Mac/Testing Fit**: Re-execution will apply latest requirements (e.g., no cloud deps, arm64-friendly). To boost this, I recommend running US-016 (setup script) manually first (it's quick Python), but we can add it as a 4th story if you want it automated in the sprint. Estimated: 15-20 minutes total\u2014foundation-first, no wireframes (refs only).\n- **How This \"Resets\"**: Saving SP-002 triggers re-gen; statuses update to \"In Sprint\" (after a quick reset call). Post-execution, you'll have fresh code/files tailored to the updated Vision (local, lightweight, Mac-compatible).\n\n**Alternatives**:\n- **Add Setup for Extra Assurance**: Include US-016 (+5 min) to auto-init the env (pip, seed data, start server) before the core\u2014makes Mac testing foolproof.\n- **Skip Reset, Just Re-Pull**: If you don't mind \"Done\" histories, we can pull directly without status change\u2014execution still regenerates.\n- **Broader Reset?**: If you want to nuke SP-001 entirely (e.g., remove Sprint_ID), let me know\u2014we can API that, but re-pulling is cleaner.\n\nDoes this proposal work for SP-002, or tweak it (e.g., add US-016, change sprint ID to SP-001-bis)? If yes, I'll handle the reset/save/updates right now. Ready to approve?"
