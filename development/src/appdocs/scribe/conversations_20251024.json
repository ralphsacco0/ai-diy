Let me summarize what we've captured to ensure we're aligned:\n\n**Project Vision Summary:**\n- **Name:** BrightHR Lite--DELME2\n- **Problem Solved:** Streamlines HR admin for small businesses (10-50 staff) by replacing error-prone spreadsheets/emails with a simple digital tool for employee data, leave requests, and compliance docs\u2014saving time and reducing mistakes.\n- **Target Users:** Small business owners (streamline admin), HR managers/office admins (track people/policies), and employees (self-service for leave/personal updates).\n- **Key Features:**\n  - **MVP Must-Haves:** Employee directory (profiles/contact info), leave/absence management (requests, approvals, calendar view), document storage (contracts/policies/compliance).\n  - **Nice-to-Haves:** Onboarding checklists, basic performance reviews, email notifications.\n- **Success Metrics:** 80% employee self-service adoption in 3 months, 50% reduction in HR admin time for leave tracking, 100% digital record completeness, \u22654/5 user satisfaction in pilot.\n- **Constraints:** Web-only (Phase 1), budget <$5K for pilot (lightweight hosting), GDPR-compliant (data export/deletion), deploy on Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (DB). Inspirations: BambooHR/CharlieHR for UI/UX; leverage existing spreadsheets for data migration.\n\nDoes this capture your vision accurately? Any tweaks, additions, or clarifications? Once you're happy, we can sign off here and move to requirements refinement or sprint planning."

Here's the draft:\n\n---\n\n# **Vision Document: BrightHR Lite--DELME2**  \n*(Draft v1.0 - Vision Meeting Output)*\n\n## **1. Project Overview**\n- **Name:** BrightHR Lite--DELME2  \n- **Objective:** Develop a lightweight HR management tool for small businesses to digitize employee data, leave tracking, and compliance documents\u2014replacing inefficient spreadsheets and emails to reduce errors, save admin time, and improve self-service for employees.\n\n## **2. Problem Statement**\nSmall businesses (10\u201350 staff) face challenges managing employee data, leave requests, and compliance documents via spreadsheets or email threads. This leads to errors, lost information, and significant wasted admin time.\n\n## **3. Target Users & Personas**\n- **Small Business Owners:** Seek to streamline overall HR admin without complexity.  \n- **HR Managers / Office Admins:** Need an intuitive way to track employee details, policies, and approvals.  \n- **Employees:** Desire simple self-service for requesting leave, updating personal info, and accessing documents.  \n*(Demographics: SMBs in non-tech sectors; users with varying tech comfort\u2014focus on ease of use.)*\n\n## **4. Key Features**\n### **MVP Must-Haves (Core Scope for Phase 1):**\n- **Employee Directory:** Basic profiles with contact info, roles, and search functionality.  \n- **Leave / Absence Management:** Employee request submission, manager approvals, and calendar view for tracking.  \n- **Document Storage:** Secure upload/storage/retrieval for contracts, policies, and compliance docs (with access controls).  \n\n### **Nice-to-Haves (Future Enhancements):**\n- Onboarding checklists for new hires.  \n- Simple performance review tracking.  \n- Automated email notifications for leave approvals and updates.\n\n## **5. Success Criteria & KPIs**\n- 80% of employees using self-service for leave requests within the first 3 months.  \n- 50% reduction in HR admin time spent on leave tracking (measured via pilot feedback).  \n- 100% completeness of digital employee records.  \n- Average user satisfaction score \u2265 4/5 from pilot participants (via surveys).\n\n## **6. Constraints & Requirements**\n- **Platform:** Web-only (no mobile app in Phase 1).  \n- **Budget & Hosting:** <$5K for pilot; lightweight setup (e.g., Vercel for frontend, Supabase for backend DB).  \n- **Compliance:** Basic GDPR adherence, including data export and deletion features.  \n- **Integrations/Tech:** Leverage existing spreadsheets for initial data migration; no complex integrations in MVP.  \n- **Timeline:** Pilot deployment within 1-2 sprints (TBD in planning).  \n\n## **7. Inspirations & Assets**\n- **Competitors/Inspirations:** BambooHR and CharlieHR for clean, intuitive UI/UX.  \n- **Existing Assets:** Current spreadsheets with employee data and leave history (to be imported).  \n\n## **Next Steps**\n- Sign-off on this draft to lock in vision.  \n- Proceed to Requirements Meeting for user stories and backlog refinement.  \n- Potential Risks: Data migration accuracy; ensuring GDPR simplicity without over-engineering.\n\n---\n\nDoes this draft look good? Any changes, or shall we mark it as approved and move forward?"
