1 current flow of sprint review alex can start in the middle of the loop need to fix how this works.

add this to requirements Constraint: All user-facing application pages MUST use flat, top-level routes only (e.g., /dashboard, /employees); requirements must not introduce nested page paths or hierarchical URLs.




9 check to make sure execution has or does not have logs in context not sure if it is needed


Done
Refactor Sprint Execution to shared project context helper
Migrate 
SprintOrchestrator._get_project_context
 / 
_get_file_summaries
 to use services.project_context + /api/sandbox so Sprint Execution and Sprint Review share the same CURRENT FILE STRUCTURE / code-reading path.

1. Make sure the first NFR-1 is tech stack and make sure it is the first thing in Sprint 1
2 Do more work in sprint planning for dependencies etc.
3. remove orchestrators hard coded file structure.

4.Srint execution needs to update backlog doc - it is done in create plan so that is not ideal but ok
