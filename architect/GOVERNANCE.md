# AI-DIY Governance

## Scope

This governs the **AI-DIY platform** (architecture, personas, APIs, documentation).

It does **NOT** apply to apps generated by AI-DIY. Those follow their own Vision → Requirements → Build → Test process.

---

## Authority

**Ralph has final authority on all platform changes. No changes without explicit approval.**

---

## FIRST STEP FOR ANY CHANGE: UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT FLOW

Before proposing or making ANY change—even a small one—you MUST understand how the current system works.

- Changing sprint execution? Read and understand the full sprint execution flow first.
- Changing a persona? Read the persona configuration and how it's loaded.
- Changing an API? Read the existing endpoint and the patterns it follows.

**Do not assume. Do not guess. Read the code and documentation first.**

---

## Core Rule: Nothing New Under the Sun

All changes must work within the existing:

| What | Where to Find It |
|------|------------------|
| Architecture | [architecture.md](./architecture.md) |
| Patterns | [PATTERNS_AND_METHODS.md](./PATTERNS_AND_METHODS.md) |
| Meeting types & personas | [system-flow.md](./system-flow.md) |
| Data schemas | [dataflow-and-schema.md](./dataflow-and-schema.md) |
| Design principles | [DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md](./DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md) |

**You may NOT:**
- Invent new architectural concepts
- Create new meeting types
- Add new personas without following existing patterns
- Contradict design principles
- Create new documentation files

**If existing patterns don't work**, you must:
1. Explain why with specific evidence
2. Propose an alternative
3. Get Ralph's explicit approval
4. Update DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md if a new principle emerges

---

## Documentation Rule

Every approved change must update existing documentation. Documentation updates are part of the Definition of Done.

Do not create new documentation files without explicit approval. Update existing docs instead.

See [DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md](./DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) for the authoritative list of documentation.
